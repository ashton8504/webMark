#### Description:   
 Browser Sort is a web application that simplifies the process of accessing frequently visited websites by allowing users to create a customized dashboard. The application is designed to make it easy for users to save links to their favorite websites and access them quickly with a single click. The application's design is implemented using CSS and Bootstrap to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface, while JavaScript provides dynamic features and functionality. The responsive design ensures the application can be used on different screen sizes without compromising functionality or user experience. Users can also customize the appearance of the dashboard, and the application offers advanced functionality that allows users to organize their favorite websites in a variety of ways. Building Browser Sort was a valuable experience that taught the developer key lessons, including the value of careful planning and design, collaboration and teamwork, understanding of web technologies, and testing and iteration. The application provides a simple and user-friendly dashboard for managing favorite websites, making browsing the internet more efficient and enjoyable.
